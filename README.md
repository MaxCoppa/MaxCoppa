# Maxime Coppa 

Second year student at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en).

Interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science.

I open source some of my projects here.

### Currently working on :

- Estimation and previvision of the performance of loyalties program of Canal+ in Africa, 7 Million subscribers.  [Data Science | Visualization | Clustering | High Performance Python] [Under Construction](https://github.com/Statapp-CANAL/Statapp-CANAL)




### Some Projects

- Pricing of a financial option and comparaison of Black-Scholes-Merton, Binomial Models Monte-Carlo models  in C++.[Project](https://github.com/MaxCoppa/Option-pricing-project), [Report](https://github.com/MaxCoppa/Option-pricing-project/blob/main/C%2B%2B%20project%20report.pdf)

- Optimization of a delivery network in Python using deterministic algorithms : Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and non deterministic algorithms : genetic algorithm and greedy algorithm. [Project](https://github.com/MaxCoppa/Transportation-network-project), [Report]()

   Sentiment analysis tool based on tweets data using various Machine Learning algorithms :  SVM algorithms; and deep learning models : 
RNNs and  CNNs. [Project]()

### Theoretical Projects 

- GeneRank Project, provide a model to compare Genes in the organism using PageRank algorithm and proved some convergence theorems with basic algebric properties. [Report](https://github.com/MaxCoppa/GeneRank-project/blob/main/GeneRank.pdf)
